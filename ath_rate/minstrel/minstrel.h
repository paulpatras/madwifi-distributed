/*-
 *  And then Indranet Technologies Ltd sponsored Derek Smithies to work
 * on this code. Derek Smithies (derek@indranet.co.nz) took parts of the 
 * adm module and pasted it into this code base. 
 *
 * This version of John Bicket's code takes the experimental approach one
 * step further.
 * When in auto rate mode, packets are sent at the selected rate.
 * The Hal asks for what alternative rate to use if the selected rate fails.
 * We provide the alternative rate from a random selection of 1.. max rate.
 * Given the probability of success, multiplied with the transmission time,
 * we can determine the rate which maximises packet throughput.
 *
 * Different rates are used for every remote node - some nodes will work 
 * better on different rates.
 * Every second, a timer fires, to assess the throughput at each rate with 
 *  each remote node.
 * This timer will then determine the optimum rate for each remote node, based
 * on the performance figures.
 *
 * This code is called minstrel, because we have taken a wandering minstrel
 * apporoch. Wander aimlessly around the different rates, singing wherever 
 * you can. And then, look at the performacnce, and make a choice.
 *
 *  Enjoy.  Derek Smithies.
