   MadWifi safe register operations:

	When hacking on registers directly, we need to use the macros below to
	avoid concurrent PCI access and abort mode errors.

	* ath_reg_read
	* ATH_REG_WRITE

   HAL-ONLY register operations:

	* _OS_REG_READ
	* _OS_REG_WRITE
	* OS_REG_READ
	* OS_REG_WRITE
	* ath_hal_reg_read.
	* ath_hal_reg_write

    When compiled in HAL:
	* We don't require locking overhead and function call except for
	  debugging.
	* All HAL operations are executed in the context of a MadWifi wrapper
	  call that holds the HAL lock.
	* Normally HAL is built with the non-modified version of this file, so
	  it doesn't have our funny macros anyway.

    When compiled in MadWifi:
	* The HAL wrapper API takes the HAL lock before invoking the HAL.
	* HAL access is already protected, and MadWifi must NOT access the
	  functions listed above.
