This directory contains the bits needed to integrate the Madwifi source
distribution into a Linux kernel source tree.  This is only recommended
on embedded systems with no kernel module support.  For standard
installation, please refer to the files in the top level directory.

To integrate MadWifi into the Linux kernel, unpack the kernel sources if
needed, then run the install.sh script from this directory.

If you want to patch the currently running system you can run install.sh
without arguments, otherwise specify the source tree location on the
command line:

./install.sh /usr/src/linux

The driver sources will be copied into drivers/net/wireless/madwifi in
the kernel sources.  Some kernel files will be patched to know about
this directory.  Files called Makefile.kernel will be renamed to
Makefile.

Now you can run "make menuconfig" or similar command and configure the
driver as you would normally do.  If the kernel is already configured,
run "make oldconfig", and you'll be asked only about Atheros driver.

It's possible to build Madwifi modules when the driver is integrated
into Linux 2.6.x, but most users should not need that.
