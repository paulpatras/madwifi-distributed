/* 
 * This file provides some macros that are used by if_ath_hal.h,
 * if_ath_hal_wrappers.h, and if_ath_hal_wrappers.c.
 * 
 * The macros are provided for the HAL lock and for dynamically deciding whether
 * to define the HAL wrapper functions as inline or in the implementation file
 * at build time.  i.e. inline for speed, or non-inline for debugging visibility
 * into the HAL methods being called (despite obfuscation).
 * 
 * The if_ath_hal.h file is generated from ath_hal/ah.h at build time by the
 * build system.
